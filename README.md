Simple Luvit Server
===================

A very simple demo I've been playing with using [luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit "Luvit"). I am just trying to see what it is like building a simple server with routes and modules.

Based on the [web-app example](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/tree/master/examples/web-app) in the luvit master repo.
